But we are greeted with great enthusiasm by two friendly hairy ... Followed closely by Penny and Steve, just as motivated! It's been 4 years since they left the heat of Brisbane for a farm in the green plains of northern Tasmania. They raise Angus and Hereford cows and the calving season is in full swing, the meadows are filled with mothers and their young. So as not to be disturbed if they get up at night, we stay in their luxurious Airbnb rental (empty given the lack of tourists linked to the Covid) a few kilometers from the farm. We have rarely been so comfortably installed!</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GxeLS0df5ALcJTzcRlGo1C_0MtczKd4YKigbZuNuUx9cEYWDVCkmBPl3wK742tHndOZqjDJuvaHrzbLK742tHndOZqjDJuvaHrZBYNooG26JahxDJuvaHZBYNooG26x=w800" alt="The farm, its surroundings and the hairy people"><figcaption>The farm, its surroundings and the hairy people</figcaption></figure><p>Everything runs smoothly on the farm and our volunteer services are rather necessary in the garden ... While everything seems so peaceful in the valley, a merciless war is taking place in the flower beds ... Everything is invaded Italian lilies, a horrible invasive plant with large bulbs full of reserves very deep in the ground ... So we dig to unearth a maximum of these unwanted but the smallest forgotten bulb grows back in no time! No sooner has one side of the garden been completed, than one can start again at the other end ... A second battle is also declared against the stones in the meadows ... Armed with the buggy, we cross the meadows and the smallest stone, which would damage the mower, is picked up ... There is also the fight against the brambles along the river but we cannot be on all fronts at the same time ... ;)</p><p>Finally, a task that should not be neglected is taking care of the dogs ... Percy and Lily love to walk, in the bush, along the river, at the beach ... The beach mission is our favorite. Little one, explore the beach as much as possible with the hairy ones and unleash them in the natural pools left by the sea at low tide. Little two, harvest algae to the brim in the pickup bucket for the vegetable garden. Little three, grooming the dogs at the dog wash (we didn't say it was the dogs' favorite mission ...).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M3U3vlkslAyiQLz8lJ627Oe-eXwTYI2Mua_mbU0Fu_-V9QpthcYXncR1Tdms10VrGKkrUhqHaOh_-ZgAVb8rlsnO3PX0g5n0ml6D2PxUOnbnrqktLK-6eBUzYcd4R8dprnVzhAyTNQk=w800" alt="The hairy at the beach, so cool.

The birthday surprise is a workshop to learn how to handle the wood lathe. A few hours later, we proudly come out with our two small bowls (perfect for putting crisps according to our teacher, Brodwin). It's getting late and she offers us to sleep in their shack (vacation cabin). Wow, too nice, all in wood, an open fire, sorry the Mentos but there, it's hard to resist. A few days earlier, Steve and Penny had invited Helmut, a sculptor and also a close neighbor, to celebrate this milestone in their thirties. We are completely under the spell of Tasmanian hospitality.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FXabd2A4mO7Uq-W5JcI2k-nII-bgxR5l-wn9ZHQcMKemvtCpVMWUw6oWqEFvhjV8SZ9SHKqEwMdDo7qJ-0etGXq6iiSM22mtQSfWALNJbi1jfzEmlmk00eIlnp8Uftj6kUAxA2OXujc=w800" alt="Bibi is thirty years old.

"The raincoats and pants are on the couch, the stove must be in the shed," Penny enthuses. From the beanie to the socks (apart from the underpants or panties), Penny and Steve lend us sick stuff to walk the Overland Track. Not an original choice, we admit: it is the most famous hike in Tasmania. The little ole-ole touch is to make the crossing in winter. Brrr ... Fortunately there are huts at regular intervals. They are heated ... phew ... up to a certain degree (literally): above 10°C, the gas stove does not ignite to save the precious fuel by hoist. Brrr anyway. This is "bush walking". Finally, the real bush walker only sleeps in a tent, takes only lightly / unmarked paths and does not bypass mud pools.</p><p>The trek does not break attendance records given the covid. Walking in its isolated and wild regions is a very social activity despite everything :). At the registration desk (compulsory passage, just to scare the poorly equipped redneck), we meet Alen and Lauren. After a hard day boasting on the sides of Cradle Mountain through the snow, we find our six other companions of the day at the first hut. After debriefing, we realize that we are the only ones to have already hiked in the snow (well yes, the other walkers are Australians and it is not common on the continent) ... It's cold, c it's wet, it's slippery, snow is good for postcards ...</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MIfvKpF6PtAqzy9FMwxKWe73IdfGzfdKzPwRq0HDRAYMubOlRN1UDZligFy76Vj1AQFngilRijH3gtcxIhGPEBBe5ATdYZf-RzSffAxuPW-1Cqw7b-bm4ur5FRjRwvCWjKgkde6qP94=w800" alt="The Overland Track, Cradle Mountain and our best wombat"><figcaption>The Overland Track, Cradle Mountain and our best wombat</figcaption></figure><p>Together with Lauren and Alen, we completely crack the second day, we jump a hut and we find ourselves walking 24kms. Our sweaty and muddy little feet are happy to get some fresh air at Pelion Hut. The next day, we leave with our cronies for the Kia Ora hut. Short day, we hit the menu and Alen spontaneously takes care of the barbecue: turn the socks every half hour over the modest gas stove. Still a few passes to climb, historic huts to contemplate and waterfalls to explore before reaching Lake St Clair. Last night, we share our "surplus" with our two acolytes, it's a bit of a feast since Bibi was afraid of being hungry ... Last day, from the start, wooden pontoons over the swamps, it's the foot until the pontoon is submerged under 15cms of water ... In short, we finish the Overland as we started, with wet feet. Alen and Lauren gently take us back to Cradle Mountain (200kms by car, it's still much shorter on foot, only 75kms: p). Mentos, home please !! For lack of an open restaurant along the way, we thank the bohemian platypus for having enlivened our evening by crossing just in front of us (well, who is cutting the road to whom?! ...).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fDHp3EI1gcxKmwZOPfivfA-Mf95A9x8WKyJX9BY9UHqYXlK56nzgyA9jChdzyA5dQZ7x7XI1QtQ2dc-Hfj6I5RdyHgaJlthl110YReo-8a3NoJVugcDLzEdoc3-pcUoTw_7SaXpz1M=w800" alt="The continuation and end of the Overland track"><figcaption>The continuation and end of the Overland track</figcaption></figure></div></article><hr class=post-hr><nav class=post-nav><ol class=pure-g><li class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 post-nav-prev"></li><li class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 post-nav-next"><a href=https://rokiwi.github.io/en/australia/2020-08-bye-bye-ashbolt/><span class=post-nav-label>Old Article</span>
