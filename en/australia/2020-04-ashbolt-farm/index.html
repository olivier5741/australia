Tasmania is still in isolation: campsites and national parks are closed, travel must be limited to the essential. Through workaway, we get in touch with Anne and Bob who need arms on their farm. We cross the island from North to South in a few hours to get to New Norfolk, near Hobart.</p><p>We stay in the old chicken coop, completely and comfortably rehabilitated. Our cute little cabin, nested in the orchard still needs some improvements to make our life easier. Anne and Bob are kind of collectors and their (huge!) sheds are full of various materials that are just waiting to be exploited. Being "experts" in recycled furniture of all types, we build shelves and drawers under the sink as well as a sofa bed. We are not the only volunteers, Elena and Mitchell live in a small container (fitted out of course) a little further. And there are three employees we work with regularly: Baden, Chris and Hendrick.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J8ucyxCM7tQXKk9lPwzWvGFJDhHtysgbW6wPDuNJC0yhch7I_IvQXsuDQ_3b7c7ezy0DuEnjFRVhq_QkNUZMWfcSn3Y96ddkDYmjrxt7CdNT14TUbDrklZhFYZQO7odKo7l_VKrAQSc=w800" alt="The cabin in the orchard.

It is a large farm which produces elders drinks (flowers and / or fruit), olive oil, Hereford cows and goats. There is, of course, the endless fence repair job, like in every farm in the world. The vegetable patch also needs attention and weeding. Apples, pears, crab apples and quinces are ripe, we pick them to be pressed before the opossums eat them. We are also starting a great process of tidying up and rearranging the sheds. There are tools and materials for all tastes, from plumber to electrician, carpenter to blacksmith, but it's like looking for a needle in haystack.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pHqQrTyQG9XeCM69c6HKoqVQoHqO-d9oEkUJfOWgsA83jDwMvTTXQocZw3kLJ2FZXzZH_X4fuacTNh7JS1eHw2CIh0abkhZtEauurmuxFL8I2Pml3Vy3aOfUCefRjXLEiem39kQzGvc=w800" alt="Cows and their dining table: a feeding sleigh totally refurbished"><figcaption>Cows and their dining table: a feeding sleigh totally refurbished</figcaption></figure><p>The farm spreads over several hectares with wooded hills and the Derwent river flows just below. The weather is no longer warm but, on a sunny day, we feel brave enough for a quick and invigorating dip. In short, it doesn't really matter "being stuck at home".</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jfi9iswl4z5rf7-q0_8VRJOVjvTw8pAVRv71eUw2N-nVjVBdSBMudNjSlsE-zLABGKDNVeh8r3K4ux3fClX0t3cdYiCwwiOMHvsjm3-ht8YmkSKoT6LaRYLDmL-p3pw7LrUd8_vKX-s=w800" alt="The Derwent Valley"><figcaption>The Derwent Valley</figcaption></figure><p>We sometimes go for a walk in Hobart or in the nearby national parks (which have reopened in the meantime).
