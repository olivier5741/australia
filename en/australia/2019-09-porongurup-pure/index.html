This chain of granitic blocks looks at us as soon as we first milk the cows and then the ewes. After milking, the calves and lambs find their moms and spend the day in the paddock. At the end of the afternoon, the youngsters are separated so there will be some milk the next morning.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t_zLR9r8IjR42EHEI9MiCYXXgcbn1t0mCkAoXp4rlKCwKIVOI8UdJrYEEsO4I0ZXsWWZm3Jjrqor4awBPObH0wWpEXcQZPIDWOh1P7Th3x1HKZdcrOAHIvGMFiQjttimZywclv90314=w800" alt="Work on the farm"><figcaption>Work on the farm</figcaption></figure><p>The udders parade, all different. The cows are placid: we install the cups and that's it :). From time to time, a new recruit makes trouble and congratulates you for putting the cups by a big poo ... Let's pay attention, it's part of the job :) ! There are between seven and nine cows to milk at the moment and they all have their little name ...</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OdF25_0_PgQ1mIHjMIkkVJFlVe6AuIP-es3GPWIsqy0vObD5adM7tHwWdrjU_z3vkR_TzTUdT1tedKC7QqDERp_1FaEXBMTpGAaCSPCtaJkPLA4h5XW2g7LoQ-o5pJHiuQHBnFjj3cE=w800" alt="The nine cows: Hope, Ginger Ninja, Big Red, Tuby, Halle, Princess Leia, Emma, Ginger Meg and Molly"><figcaption>The nine cows: Hope, Ginger Ninja, Big Red, Tuby, Halle, Princess Leia, Emma, Ginger Meg and Molly</figcaption></figure><p>Ewes are more &quot;ticklish&quot; and require more attention, their udders are often asymmetrical. Some open the locks and flood the milk system, others need to be convinced by small massages. After six weeks of work, some of the 76 are recognized thanks to their bump. There is Santa with a beard of Santa Claus on the udder, very high Giraffe on skinny legs, Princess and her behind completely pink, Beaver with her plump tail, ...</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_d-euGusDMhmkEul9dP14imjEZyjIGeXrTCkxPp51xMr-QLoDzsXSqVUDTcHih-MHUpYwuuO-_b_0n0D7N7PZ4uLf1V-U9Lx5ocN-tmlZLayXDib5NumaU46Q-k5GVrjg81BdQ0LhqY=w800" alt="In the sheep dairy"><figcaption>In the sheep dairy</figcaption></figure><p>What do you do with all that milk? Cheese of course: Brie and Camembert, feta, fresh curd, Cheddar, Pecorino, Manchego. But milk is also sold fresh (sheep milk is particularly sought after by people intolerant to lactose). Yoghurt, kefir, flavoured milks, fresh cream, marinated feta and Boursin are also made. Everything is done on the farm and it keeps us busy two or three days a week. These delicious products are sold in various stores and restaurants in the area and also directly to the famous weekly appointment of the Albany farmer's market. We finally find real bread :) !! And so many other delicious local foods such as asparagus, mushrooms, avocados, ...</p><p>First major project: the construction of a new chickenhouse. It can accommodate a dozen chickens, set above the ground to avoid snakes, built in remnants of jarrah (rotproof hard red wood), with easy cleaning system, its the Rolls-Royce of chickenhouses! We are waiting for a few new hens to finish the project and check its resistance to foxes.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ObkAzj7a5UUK3_s4p2Qy27Fuj2jbzNPTmqMOXSttWwT6vwz9Ui-P985L6gpuun-ZVxKVEMvL0cP0niPCbyP4vtkip6Ndsu72g5QMOc45FtsN8oFtY691lSYHuWs8_KioID9eK2aCOYM=w800" alt="The construction of the chicken coop.

He grew up well in our absence and &quot;speaks&quot; profusely: our new names are Wivi and Anna. Olivier is his absolute idol. The family also welcomed a new puppy, Harrison. He still has a lot to learn before becoming an effective sheepdog but attracts significant sympathy. It is common practice in the household to name animals after people: Hope (the cow) has given birth to a small Olivier and Tubby has a little Rosanna.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TLJ4Hs8Rn-Zvp0NK4liENCBw-G4STRKRHFzBv1_j5ocC5KtoQS5PallTUVbNaSBG5CxMyiXQukQHI1yhvx433x7lH4463FCtQQi2ICjsqcto9ajyHDA9_iIDBcFKpHhZUQkvbv4H4Wg=w800" alt="Rosanna and Olivier (the calves), Harry, when he was still fitting into the box and Emerson in his company car"><figcaption>Rosanna and Olivier (the calves), Harry, when he was still fitting into the box and Emerson in his company car</figcaption></figure><p>Spring is on the way! We enjoy some very nice days and go to the beach. Whether after the market with Emerson and family (although the latter, terror of the sandpit, is actually scared of the waves) or just the two of us at Two People's Bay with these turquoise waters and its white sand; the ocean always has something magical.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0ZgwzV-i7yoXzPiOFhfjUm-tAXkWOs2spD3N5cioMfhWaNhP7wcR11Q7uVmreihb5662NgA_JdrFcyozTZRwnsTjffYrCWWRMeSjwv5jVdr3NPiCXi6dy8G5PUQ6RZWJ3yQrljY7QVo=w800" alt="Two People's Bay and some of the farm particularities: Emma and her two huge calves (Batgirl, in black, and Kenny) and Rupert, the pet buffalo"><figcaption>Two People's Bay and some of the farm particularities: Emma and her two huge calves (Batgirl, in black, and Kenny) and Rupert, the pet buffalo</figcaption></figure><p>We spent a few days in Bunbury to say hello to our co-volunteers from Carey Downs: Glenys and Rod, the adventurous 80-year-old couple.
