Not exactly what we encounter this time :) ... We spent a week in the middle of tens of thousands of hectares of forests. Wherever we go Karri, Marri, Jarrah (different species of eucalyptus) look us down and sometimes from the top of their 80m. That's a lot of wood! Abundantly exploited after the Second World War, these huge eucalyptus trees were used to build houses, railway lines, bridges all over the world. Currently, most of these forests are national parks that we browse for the greatest pleasure of our legs.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a6joOd143z3AvRJIqp5XFLIbpWZ0NkCifTauZY6wNT_O8lf4Q1K5jINtl2zrAaV4ZyConkEbdt6tpFzoGqo8HcuCpXr5AO4eSP3RVuiwrQIjpsTwGLjRmBgmqJVPSAEH5hestoIuK-E=w800" alt="A eucalyptus mishmash.

But, the trees are so high that it's a lot of work to build a tower higher than them, some had the idea to put a platform directly at the top of the tree. Three of these semi-natural watchtowers are still accessible to the public. A spiral of metal pegs, in its simplest device, takes you to the top of the canopy. Thrills guaranteed! Another way to gain height is to climb large blocks of granite that emerge from the landscape. It makes you realize that in the region, if you want to be alone, you can be alone! ;)</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yqsimSavyHNP4IJ4u703c9rqow8yxm3VXUjp7WQ5-ovZ3FRPmj1sBf9Ys1W_skcwG0yIhM-24ENcVlwTpiI386VNwkhJwa1V2LYmOiED9bEaG-x_eVh5tG5ns9z4vyIY1BOoOZF5QMI=w800" alt="The three towers.

It's a fact, biodiversity is one of Australia's gems. But there is also History ... In millions of years, the Australian continent acquires its independence by unhooking the super continent of the southern hemisphere, there are impressive rocky remains dating back to those distant times. In thousands of years, there is the establishment of Aborigines on their island. Very close to nature, it is a set of peoples with very different languages ​​and legends (we hope to be able to tell you more later). Hundreds of years ago, the first European settlers in Western Australia set foot in Albany, a prolific whaling station (many whales cross its shallow waters to rest on their way to their annual migration (we have not seen any, it was not the season :)). Then, they infiltrate inland attracted by farmland and forest potential. Finally, it is from the port of Albany that the Australian and New Zealand troops left to lend a hand to the English (and their allies) during World War II.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h5LpeDBvITrUyzlG3cup1n2FnXe-DgqhF9KJ2k6MuE6OedqjPO3mIExjzKSVr95r0XKVb45n8qv5QoWxRJ6myd97S185L7O94PooLFEMYLrSNYiubzZAkd96FzEZnjZP_GLFqJyrofg=w800" alt="Light Field to commemorate the soldiers who left from Albany.
