Our team of moms dropped us at the airport ... We knew that our luggage was not very heavy but 25kg for two, we are proud of us! (especially Rossana) (We learned from our past mistakes and have an emotional thought for all the more or less useless things we carried for a year in New Zealand;))</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mSjyLnlHgrPNow7P1delEbL7FpS3NM3NRJPmmFRbOU1SseqgHwMgvhhxn8NyLEI2LsMkwGTIYH9UIlKYQYPupdWQGI_xG0PwWpHPc5DZYvl3Dcj5BzHHmfwC6SLGO-f39iRob10qeig=w800" alt="Our backpacks"><figcaption>Our backpacks</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CviGuJgF0iOBqqat7PLQobYNmhQ3nWwgUWD6DxbgAlHTp0FxgHqhTgc5ZaWsOdDzJhyobBeBGyI9O30gbJMTqoK9LqCoyWRCRprfav41VjBraHNsDR3U-yEpiajIsFExQ9LDU1W7VEE=w800" alt="Zaventem Airport before takeoff"><figcaption>Zaventem Airport before takeoff</figcaption></figure><p>The trip went smoothly, our luggage did not even get lost. We set foot on the island continent almost &quot;fresh&quot; (there is only 7h jetlag). Leaving the air conditioning of the airport, we are blown by the heat and Olivier hastens to change shoes and unzip his pants in shorts ...</p><p>We have an appointment with David, our host, in the suburbs of Perth. FYI, Perth is on the west coast of Australia, 4000 km from Sydney. It is the largest city in Western Australia and the fourth largest in Australia. In short, a big city in the middle of nowhere ...</p><p><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TQMR8r-h7GuoWmBFRdvxfw5qb8RoH27c1CCBPFHWXE2Vr2FxhEWZTJmhr6CGJ27lsAB8IIwaEuPUzQNUXXltL5RmpQqNh15U_ue9sRjjDT5p3hGJbU8kG4E_F2u_e0WxsUMvCL5pNEA" title = "Perth.

In exchange for half a day's work, we are housed and fed. As good volunteers, we take care of the maintenance of the exteriors, we help him in some administrative tasks and, most important, we spend time with Luna, the dog of the house ...
