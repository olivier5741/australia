Who would've believed that? Innes National Park, on the edge of the Yorke Peninsula, keeps its promises. Its deadly charm has pierced more than one hull, evidenced by the many wrecks lying sometimes at the bottom, sometimes fully exposed on the beach. Dolphins and cute kangaroos on the beach are sure to brighten up their coat of arms. On the way to a natural swimming pool dug in the rocks, we witness, from afar (we did not dare to invite each other in a bathing suit), to a wedding on the beach. Yep, it's not just in American movies. Even the lighthouses on the peninsula are designer. After a visit to the ghost town of Inneston, built to house those who exploited the gypsum, the bitumen is tickled along the sole of the foot.</p><p>![The beautiful beaches of Innes National Park] (<a href=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U8EPJlQFdqDVGjbDpNF0wsTx_MYGol2OKWK4u1j0ZJVQvqoAfAmy0DPTekzmpWr25EvweFwR1LdcBYQ7gxvWua6f9le4Mwxkp5MnXyBbHXrpbHx-Wy-jUee1nRwdnwHUP8UERElLz0o>https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U8EPJlQFdqDVGjbDpNF0wsTx_MYGol2OKWK4u1j0ZJVQvqoAfAmy0DPTekzmpWr25EvweFwR1LdcBYQ7gxvWua6f9le4Mwxkp5MnXyBbHXrpbHx-Wy-jUee1nRwdnwHUP8UERElLz0o</a>)</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lkBwJuuWw27M8-vSt2nP16FvaVCS4bsWMPEBbcAy7oCDMsj10zJ_Z6gkt9uiBn5ERxJXVhg1MFTM2QkvEvar4wrZzNeOh3bBo6tz6rRrqA8lorNeCqCk7ycdqLRpxffa7wcNd6ivyqQ=w800" alt="Innes National Park, its mining past, shipwrecks and shark egg"><figcaption>Innes National Park, its mining past, shipwrecks and shark egg</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/INbxSxtlPd4cNmNpniKCO8HFNntl1fXKDoatJL9ljIXx22vCSz9FTf4ydhNi4p31-IqUcUVJMe2sLPTbGEBEMfoCPnrERHZ4OOqz-a-2ireQBwWcgTjkhGrrztRVApVzxxzh-4AJI9w=w800" alt="Innes National Park and its kangaroos"><figcaption>Innes National Park and its kangaroos</figcaption></figure><figure><video width=100% style=max-width:800px controls>

The logistics are such that we travel it on weekends, in the company of almost all the inhabitants of Adelaide looking for a campsite on one of these "wild" beaches (which therefore looks more like a refugee camp than a wild beach :)). On Fleurieu, the sometimes wooded landscape in the national parks, sometimes lunar along the rocky cliffs is punctuated by imposing grassy hills yellowed by drought.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OxFdihvym1zm_ww6ZDqt4J18TdUioZR0XmXpePWssKMCM9coD6k6f1Nbj_QfQX_ytZ9QhJbooifYwL5G2FYazz49X2Ual90onZhpur3UL9KsQy2TY53-NN5tzh_RhbzV1GmUr2AQZRs=w800" alt="A moon scent along the Fleurieu cliffs"><figcaption>A moon scent along the Fleurieu cliffs</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LwPxPGeYOYVJaneB3Z9Pxwy6aEeYYtxQw4rE8gXZ6fNvyUY_z47YSQbyMLfdm2_vg9qYu9uGYhq1ZL8TjPo-tb0i2tLMZYMQpo4oBlJ5tScqzzAMCEZsHTRerdtwfn2ISz0nuu8SdOM=w800" alt="The Fleurieu Peninsula, between land and sea"><figcaption>The Fleurieu Peninsula, between land and sea</figcaption></figure><p>Bypassing Lake Alexandrina and Yari, we cross what was once Australian Mississippi. Paddle steamers connected the various ports of this immense complex of lakes. The Murray River winds its way through this labyrinth and the shortest path crosses the river several times. There is no bridge. Putting the Mentos on a barge to cross the longest river in Australia takes us to the Netherlands for a short crossing. A lagoon of more than 100km (distance altogether banal in this country-continent) separated from the ocean by a simple sand dune constitutes the national park of Coorong. This complex ecosystem is threatened by prolonged drought, dams and pumping of water throughout the course of the Murray which could one day stop flowing and silting up the lagoon. For the moment, the mouth of the river is kept open artificially by dredging. It is a paradise for pelicans and other birds ...</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g221RAzV2255CL5qqXyRRa-uFPkkhCPhNXrDvwbrf5ZCd_Uqj4jc00lGIGmR1WpDielotBqlpPwL22nOg6vyp4ciSCS1vxlcRTcQHDHzu1zS2W2mI81Yz-2mDyPM5T7wcSWcqd7GOe8=w800" alt="Around Lake Alexandrina and a dredging ship the mouth of the Murray River"><figcaption>Around Lake Alexandrina and a dredging ship the mouth of the Murray River</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gMfdfbU5LgshTrbPHeeZO8WIOXDnBbKajiHIwC25qIJnHOvqeRxuFX_p_QehYsT8E5hDYsIl3t4HMZXgZyCsx5FyBvz6RGoylbmSohjOxT0fd9QbM3PCgpFnME98AstLzTnXIl1i5pM=w800" alt="Meningie, the pelican paradise.

At the end of 1800, a particularly skinny Irish emigrant made a living by robbing the premises and fled on the back of an ostrich in the marshes.
