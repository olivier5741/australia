No more cork tap and oak cask! Here we're modern&mldr;</p><p>Who never felt &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; is watching you at each time you go on internet when you stay at less than 200m from one of the main spying stations in the world (the second name of the valley where we wwoof is Spy Valley)?</p><p>What do you think of buying two plates in a second hand shop while you're feeling a 6.4 earthquake?</p><p>Who never felt totally spoiled if your wwoof host serves you burgers, pizzas, Tacos or hot dogs every lunch and if you spend your afternoon lolling next to the heated swimming pool?</p><p>Who, children of Europe, never ran out of arguments to defend it against eurosceptics (our host Jeremy)? Who, European, never felt guilty eating food subsidised by the CAP?</p><p>So, Rosemary and Jeremy, Kiwis in their 70's, settled in the Waihopai Valley to grow olives and peonies. Strange mix? Not so strange in their valley with a cranky weather because frost is good for peonie growing but bad for olives and you never know what you'll get for winter. Tastier than every Italian olive oil, their oil was sadly not profitable enough. So new crop: now a vineyard replaces the olive trees.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qzD1G5JYQuA/VU2c8ShamKI/AAAAAAAAFMA/aM7Q23vvrm8/s1280/PhotoGrid_1430470265573.jpg =w800 alt="The vineyard, the grape harvesting machine and it's job done on the left; the two white &lsquo;balls&rsquo; from Spy Valley in the centre; the peonies, before and after pruning on the right"><figcaption>The vineyard, the grape harvesting machine and it's job done on the left; the two white &lsquo;balls&rsquo; from Spy Valley in the centre; the peonies, before and after pruning on the right</figcaption></figure><p>Morning is busy with peonies autumn pruning, morally assisted by Archie and Jessy (the two old dogs from the house). And after a hearty lunch, free afternoon: lolling at the swimming pool or discovering Blenheim and its surroundings. After a hearty dinner (no need to tell you we put some weight on in this wwoofing), we choose our evening cinema programme among their huge variety of DVDs and watch it in our room.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IabLRq_ZEbI/VU2c8w-iBuI/AAAAAAAAFMM/TiqTFUZxBDU/s1280/PhotoGrid_1430469333858.jpg =w800 alt="At Rose and Jeremy's : the garden, the house and Archie"><figcaption>At Rose and Jeremy's : the garden, the house and Archie</figcaption></figure><h3 id=kiwi-film-suggestions->Kiwi film suggestions :</h3><ul><li>&ldquo;The world fastest Indian&rdquo; with A.
