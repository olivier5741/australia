We're not ready yet for this huge city so we close our eyes and we drive! (And it's pouring rain!) [we're not sure we'll find a job in Brussels when we come back] After all a little walk to a waterfall on the heights of the city won't do any harm&mldr;</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g_lOsoQXMBo/ViWAk9YaI2I/AAAAAAAAI0Q/3VTpUa35JVY/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445245654598.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Waitakare' ranges"><figcaption>alt="Waitakare Ranges"</figcaption></figure><p>NB: we cross Dargaville, kumara (NZ sweet potato) capital. We're still wondering why we didn't buy a 10kg bag.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K2bhsuSEFss/ViWAcjzGVuI/AAAAAAAAI0E/xHMPBRyseMc/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445245945860.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Camping' in pahi"><figcaption>alt="Camping in Pahi"</figcaption></figure><p>On our way along the West coast, we greet some old timers: Yakas, the 4 sisters, Tane Mahuta and co. This kauri gang from Waipua forest is hundreds years old and tens of metres thick, they are really huge! Like the colossus with feet of clay, these giants have tiny little roots, quickly damaged by mobs of tourists. Please stay on the wooden path (not made out of kauri wood :) ).</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MHf6URgJ3p4/ViWAlzRS9vI/AAAAAAAAI0U/WnHXxHvpA_M/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445246183734.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Kauris"'><figcaption>alt="Kauris"</figcaption></figure><p>These trees were young shoots when Europeans arrived (they might not keep them in their hearts, many are not here anymore to talk about it). Anyway, settlements in the area were amongst the first built by Europeans thanks to the wood industry.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wJH8d07MAkw/ViWA0Cl70SI/AAAAAAAAI0c/jle0SaWKGaw/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445246502667.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Hokianga' harbour and mangrove"><figcaption>alt="Hokianga Harbour and mangrove"</figcaption></figure><p>Rawene, with its 16 churches and its ferry to cross Hokianga harbour, is really cute. Original pee break in Kawakawa where the art Deco toilets were created by Austrian architect Undertwasser. And we arrived with an empty bladder in Russell at Eoan and Lisette.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jjGoCOP1kno/ViWA1qMyrZI/AAAAAAAAI0k/teBo4Pn6WsM/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445246848684.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Rawene"'><figcaption>alt="Rawene"</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yXHNXL-Oz6I/ViWA4gzKWaI/AAAAAAAAI0s/43Bzsy7dpKY/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445247116534.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Koutu' boulders"><figcaption>alt="Koutu boulders"</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UG0BcJtNo2U/ViWBN3o6rII/AAAAAAAAI00/IxuYdMmUcEs/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445247269407.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Artistic' loo"><figcaption>alt="Artistic loo"</figcaption></figure><p>We met them in Samoa and this kiwi couple, nature guides, invited us in their cabin &ldquo;at the back of their garden&rdquo;. And what a garden! Kiwis and wekas (even rarer than the kiwis) are nesting only a few metres away from where we sleep. It's even almost noisy at night ;)</p><p>Weka sound:</p><p></p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-svCBIdgmwiM/ViWBVkHtEkI/AAAAAAAAI08/-9IoSDE2Mwg/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445247933661.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Eoan' and lisette's cabin"><figcaption>alt="Eoan and Lisette's cabin"</figcaption></figure><p>We're experiencing a new kind of hospitality: couch surfing. Unlike wwoofing, our hosts don't have any little jobs for us but they don't provide food. It doesn't matter because they show us how to harvest cockles and oysters at low tide (Eoan is an oyster farmer) YUM&mldr;</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JXG6hUdpvVo/ViWBYbjZ-8I/AAAAAAAAI1E/CQsFrfGXuWY/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445248149469.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Wekas,' seafood collection and ferry crossing with the car"><figcaption>alt="Wekas, seafood collection and ferry crossing with the car"</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J3SA0a1IMkQ/ViWBgw81kSI/AAAAAAAAI1Q/V5JT8uaRQBE/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445249157281.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Russell"'><figcaption>alt="Russell"</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iTYS1Sfjfk4/ViWBhhuFZ1I/AAAAAAAAI1U/UlcvaOJaJ6Y/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1445249370280.jpg =w800 alt='alt="Tapeka' point and maiki, the flag mast with the union jack was cut four times by hone heke, a rebel maori chief"><figcaption>alt="Tapeka Point and Maiki, the flag mast with the Union Jack was cut four times by Hone Heke, a rebel Maori chief"</figcaption></figure><p>The next part of our trip is another way to meet the locals: volunteering for the Department Of Conservation in Mimiwhangata national park, between Russell and Whangarei.</p><p>PS : This is almost the end of our kiwi adventure and we can't bring the Chariot back to Europe. If you want to come for one year in New Zealand or if you know somebody who wants to come for one year in New Zealand, know that we're selling this &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; car at a friendly price early November in Auckland.</p></div></article><hr class=post-hr><nav class=post-nav><ol class=pure-g><li class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 post-nav-prev"><a href=https://rokiwi.github.io/en/nz/2015-09-28-mimiwhangata/><span class=post-nav-label>New Article</span>
