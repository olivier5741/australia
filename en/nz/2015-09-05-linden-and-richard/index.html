We are looking for illegal weeds : pampa grass is one of it. Our uniform is &mldr; blue of course, and we never go out without our weapons : a bottle of glyphosate, a shark and a talkie.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YYyyH4a6YVY/VgcmOuCvkjI/AAAAAAAAIo0/riJGyQUe760/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443089051376.jpg =w800 alt=Fighting the pest><figcaption>Fighting the pest</figcaption></figure><p>Pampa grass, wooly nightshade and honeysuckle are what we are targeting the most. It's a pest and you better get rid of it if you want to restore the native bush as our host. Invasive animals (stoats, weasel and ferrets) have no rest as well. Traps are all over the property : we help to trigger it and put a new bait. The bait is an egg sprayed with a perfume a human would qualify disgusting but a mustelid cannot resist to (everyone's tastes are different). Then you throw the old egg onto a predefined target (often a tree) with or without success. Since kiwis nest in the valley, it's crucial to catch those little carnivorous mammals.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jD3xf5Pv1Ps/VgcmOg50vqI/AAAAAAAAIo4/J1zOK-LQ55w/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443089580739.jpg =w800 alt=The house, the pets (bd, gully and a couple of swallows), the pool (and by the way the shower to spare water in summer)><figcaption>The house, the pets (BD, Gully and a couple of swallows), the pool (and by the way the shower to spare water in summer)</figcaption></figure><p>Weeding the garden and making compost are still part of our more traditional wwoofing life. Both our host are retired teacher even if they still correct our pronunciation (&lsquo;thistle&rsquo; was/is quite hard). Richard was lecturer at Auckland University, specialised in aboriginal and Pacific's traditional music (Samoa, Tonga, Papua-New-Guinea and some even less-known islands). Linden was an orchestra conductor, a music and english teacher. She also taught refugees how to fit in kiwi way of life. Often we get through the evening playing speed Scrabble or Farkle (a dice game).</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-djF-DBMn0Lc/VgcmOr_6CyI/AAAAAAAAIo4/35Ki3xSZ4Bk/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443088560253.jpg =w800 alt=The garden and the shade house><figcaption>The garden and the shade house</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Nj-HANnq8y8/VgcmOrC7LfI/AAAAAAAAIo4/NpTm0_2en_U/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443089837995.jpg =w800 alt=Sea compost harvest><figcaption>Sea compost harvest</figcaption></figure><p>Once again we won't miss the opportunity to explore the area : Coromandel Peninsula. We come across the first kauris. Those giant trees can live for hundreds of years. Massive logging happened when the European arrived but now they are protected and the ones that remain are impressive.</p><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-V3CfVuT-kNk/VgcmOl1QeZI/AAAAAAAAIo4/-jxG5AXiZyo/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443088335116.jpg =w800 alt=The coastal walk right at the end of coromandel peninsula><figcaption>The Coastal Walk right at the end of Coromandel Peninsula</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O5Oty-YVz1M/VgcmOieH5ZI/AAAAAAAAIo4/A1cSQMBlAMg/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443087801425.jpg =w800 alt=The coastal walk again and an unusual walker : a gecko><figcaption>The Coastal Walk again and an unusual walker : a gecko</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vsnRQsjvFmw/VgcmOts8GjI/AAAAAAAAIo4/66Nnns4pZ9U/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443086874756.jpg =w800 alt=Hahei and a north island dotterel/tūturiwhatu><figcaption>Hahei and a North Island dotterel/tūturiwhatu</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xmLBeBphZF8/VgcmOnxozLI/AAAAAAAAIo4/EbM8PSqE1U8/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443086561583.jpg =w800 alt=Cathedral cove (the tourist season is striking again, we have to park 30min away since the main parking is full &hellip; )><figcaption>Cathedral Cove (the tourist season is striking again, we have to park 30min away since the main parking is full &mldr; )</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1s3U5W4D28U/VgcmOhCGqdI/AAAAAAAAIo0/shS71r6m_to/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443086042751.jpg =w800 alt=Two gold mines : out of use and the other, the crater, is still running (not for very long since it's meant to be a lake soon)><figcaption>Two gold mines : one out of use and the other, the crater, is still running (not for very long since it's meant to be a lake soon)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IkmQ2KkUMTQ/VgcmOmTGZWI/AAAAAAAAIo4/YRXG1J_Pxrw/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443090621264.jpg =w800 alt=Another waterfall (we ain't bored yet)><figcaption>Another waterfall (we ain't bored yet)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EYq5yb8ya98/VgcmOivSQLI/AAAAAAAAIo0/MBNqrAXfD3U/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443090195949.jpg =w800 alt=Coromandel town and the kauris : in coroglen, along 309 road (the local gravel 66)><figcaption>Coromandel town and the kauris : in Coroglen, along 309 road (the local gravel 66)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2_GDT9-gmHI/VgcmOlSUM_I/AAAAAAAAIo0/roVVGeZZwIo/s912-Ic42/PhotoGrid_1443091000843.jpg =w800 alt=Phytopathologic highlight : kauris are dying from a soilborne fungus (phytophthora). to keep the disease from spreading, you ought to brush and disinfect your shoes before and after each walk.><figcaption>Phytopathologic highlight : kauris are dying from a soilborne fungus (Phytophthora).
