To show you the transformation of olives into oil, we thought we would make a great video ... But the lights weren't good, we didn't have time, ... Fortunately, a professional photographer came by on the first day of the harvest, the weather was very nice, he had a drone ... In short, his video sells dreams !! In truth, it was sometimes a little less glamorous ... It's noisy, it hurts your shoulders and neck and, on some days, there is so much fog that you can't see the end of the row. ..;)

We were probably not photogenic enough that day to appear in the video :p.

We still have Bruny Island, off Hobart, and the Tasman Peninsula to visit in the south. Thanks to two great weekends, it's now done! Clear waters, walks on jagged capes, absent tourists, we are spoiled!

Suddenly, with almost half an orchard left to harvest, Bob and Anne decided that there was no money left to pay the pickers. We therefore fall back to the status of volunteers for a week. And here we are again on a trip!

![Hartz National Park](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CpF9BOqBZaLlU_ykRtAa9WRx9lIX69X-VJGpwcIxewqnXwJROWPqJIJNP8E0yglJ0WhfnMxfz_eynumqk2r8RXJXR5lsJglgIUpJOat9rDM5dkZVYXn0tJCXkFhqEcrMppO_q76m9fM)

Spring is on the way, the days are getting longer, it is milder (except the day when it snows to remind us that it is still winter!) ... We cross the Midlands, north-east of Hobart. They are huge sheep plains, flooded by recent rains, punctuated by small historic towns. We tried to camp the first night in the high hills around but the snow prevented us from climbing a small hill to park flat. The Mentos has very poor grip and despite our many blankets it would not have been a hot night ...

We therefore branch off towards the east coast. In Bicheno, we scan the sea to see migrating whales ... But they are not there today! There are a few seals sunbathing on a rock and a whole colony of noisy penguins after dark (we can't take pictures of them so as not to blind them with the flash).

In the charming little village of St Marys, we go to the caf√©: "Are you doing well with computers?" asks the manager at all costs. It's a mission for Bibi! The consumer screen of the cash register no longer displays anything ... After an hour of troubleshooting, we set off again with peace of mind, the screen works. A well-deserved shower and a forest walk later, we reach the ocean at Bay of Fires. The lichen is sparkling orange, the sun works our complexion, but the name "Bay of Fires" comes from the fires kept by the aborigines on the beach during the passage of the first explorers. At the end of the day, we toast a ginger beer on the beach while enjoying an incredible sunset. The next day, we reach the most north-eastern point of the island: Larapuna and its lighthouse.

The season may not be optimal for climbing summits but showers give body to the waterfalls. Halls Falls, St Columba Falls, Ralph Falls did not disappoint us. Even at Lylidale Falls, giant ferns were everywhere. Too bad the platypus this morning, in the pond of the public park, stole the candle of the best attraction of the day.

![The center of the northwest. A pademelon, a platypus and a pioneer chopped into a stump.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NUbPiIM35V1WBVagDSm-WOgRRcMqKabNU4OwrEz-qcCdyjCG6gvJjvd_IGaOUkjK5qp642jccSKpyFH3gKD6yM4OqVoYwqsJ6XpckXyi3Qk7Ysv0UIIw6tCLQhUvo2Lfja2O0cuCkLQ)

We follow the Tamar River to its mouth, where Narawntapu National Park begins. We race the sun in its home straight to reach the top of Archer's Knob. On the way back, in the dark, you have to be careful not to stumble on a wallaby or a pademelon (tiny cousin of the kangaroo) in this Tasmanian Serengeti.

Today, last day before finding the comfort (and what comfort !!) of volunteering in Gunns Plains. We zigzag between the drops to go observe the birds of Narawntapu from a cache. But, considering the rain, it's a bit like "I'm staying at my house" with poultry. It continues to rain, we sneak in Devonport to the post office to collect Olivier's birthday mail and nothing: the sorting center in Melbourne is a little slowed down because of the confinement. Then, the windshield on the head, we walk along the "platypus walk" in Latrobe (rightly proclaimed capital of our monotreme friend) and not a single one will come to greet us. It's okay, there are penguins in Penguin (the town). We had to order a strategic fish at the fish'n'chips to learn from the waitress that they weren't arriving for a few weeks ... We don't let ourselves be put down, a hot shower awaits us at the little campsite in Riena. Hmm, it's winter, we didn't warn the manager, so the boiler is not on. There are days like this: D, strongly at Penny and Steve's !!
