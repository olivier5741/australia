We arrive at Penny and Steve's cottage on a gloomy rainy day ... But we are greeted with great enthusiasm by two hairy doggies ... Followed closely by Penny and Steve, just as motivated! It's been 4 years since they left the heat of Brisbane for a farm in the green plains of northern Tasmania. They raise Angus and Hereford cows and the calving season is in full swing, the meadows are filled with mothers and their young. So as not to be disturbed if they get up at night, we stay in their luxurious Airbnb rental (empty given the lack of tourists due to Covid) a few kilometers from the farm. We have rarely been so comfortably installed, jay !

Everything runs smoothly on the farm and our volunteer services are mostly required in the garden (especially Roro's agronomy expertise) ... The valley is quiet and peaceful while a merciless war is taking place in the flower beds ... The garden is invaded by Italian lilies, a horrible invasive plant with large bulbs full of reserves deeply ingrained in the ground ... So we dig to unearth a maximum of these unwanted party-poopers but the smallest forgotten bulb grows back in no time! As soon a one side of the garden is completed, than we can start again on the other side ... A second battle is also declared against the stones in the meadows ... With our fighting vehicle, the buggy, we cross the meadows and the smallest stone, which would damage the mower, is picked up ... There is also the fight against the blackberries along the river but we cannot be on all fronts at the same time ... ;)

Finally volunteers should not neglect the task of showing some love to the dogs :) ... Percy and Lily enjoy walking, in the bush, along the river, at the beach ... The beach mission is our favourite. Firstly, explore the beach as much as possible with the doggies and let them wander freely in the natural pools left by the sea at low tide. Secondly, fill the boot of the pickup with algae to fertilize the the vegetable garden. And last, groom the dogs at the dog wash (we didn't say it was the dogs' favourite mission ...).

![The doggies at the beach, so cool. The dog ​​wash, not as cool :) ...](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M3U3vlkslAyiQLz8lJ627Oe-eXwTYI2Mua_mbU0Fu_-V9QpthcYXncR1Tdms10VrGKkrUhqHaOh_-ZgAVb8rlsnO3PX0g5n0ml6D2PxUOnbnrqktLK-6eBUzYcd4R8dprnVzhAyTNQk)

Will thirty bowl Bibi over ? Not at all, it's an opportunity to keep on learning : the birthday surprise is a wood-turning workshop to make ... a bowl. And few hours later, we proudly come out with our two small "crisps containers" : it's what our teacher, Brodwin, is mainly using them for :). It's getting late and she offers us to sleep in their shack. Wow, so nice, completed made out of wood, an open fire, sorry the Mentos but it's pretty hard to resist. A few days earlier, Steve and Penny invited Helmut, a sculptor and also a close neighbour, to celebrate the thirty milestone. You can't beat tasmanian hospitality.

"Would you need some socks!" wonders Steve. "The raincoats and pants are on the couch, the cooking stove must be in the shed," enthuses Penny. From the beanie to socks (except the undies), Penny and Steve lend us some amazing gear to walk the Overland Track. Rather mainstream we must admit, it's the most famous hike in Tasmania. The little "off the beaten track" touch is to make the crossing in winter. Brrr ... Fortunately there are huts at regular intervals. They are heated ... phew ... up to a certain degree (literally): above 10°C, the gas stove does not ignite to save the precious chopper-brought fuel. Brrr anyway. This is bush walking ... the real bush walker only sleeps in a tent, takes only poorly oe unmarked paths and does not bypass mud pools.

The trek doesn't break any attendance records given covid. Walking in this isolated and wild region may be suprisingly social. At the registration desk (mandatory prelude to scare the poorly equipped redneck), we meet Alen and Lauren. After a hard day  crawling through the snow on the sides of Cradle Mountain, we meet our six other companions of the day at the first hut. After debriefing, we realize that we are the only ones to have already hiked in the snow (well yes, the other walkers are Australians and it is not common on the continent) ... It's cold, it's wet, it's slippery, snow is good for postcards ...

Together with Lauren and Alen, we go beyond the limits the second day by skipping a hut and we end up walking 24kms. Our sweaty and muddy little feet are happy to get some fresh air at Pelion Hut. The next day, we leave with our two buddies for the Kia Ora hut. Short day, Lauren deals the cards and Alen spontaneously takes care of the barbecue: turning the socks over every half an hour hoping they will dry on the tiny gas stove. Still a few gaps to climb, historic huts to visit and waterfalls to explore before reaching Lake St Clair. Last night, we share our "extra" with our mates, it's a bit of a feast since Bibi was afraid of being hungry ... Last day, from a lovely start on wooden pontoons over the swamps it turns further out it's submerged under 15cms of water ... In short, we finish the Overland as we started, with wet feet. Alen and Lauren gently bring us back to Cradle Mountain (200kms by car, it's still much shorter on foot, only 75kms: p). Mentos, home please !! The lack of an open restaurant on the way back is largely compensated by a bohemian platypus crossing the road  just in front of us (well, who is cutting off / being cut off ?! ...).
