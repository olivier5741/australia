Australia has only one leg. Like Italy to Europe, Australia also has its boot: the Yorke peninsula.

Eremophila alternifolia, Santalum acuminatum, Grevillea parallelinervis, ... The botanical garden is the perfect opportunity to practice your Latin, we scrupulously review the names of these plants with unusual characteristics: all shots are allowed to preserve or extract the least drop of water from this arid continent.

We reach the most attractive part of the leg: the toes. Who would've believed that? Innes National Park, on the edge of the Yorke Peninsula, keeps its promises. Its deadly charm has pierced more than one hull, evidenced by the many wrecks lying sometimes at the bottom, sometimes fully exposed on the beach. Dolphins and cute kangaroos on the beach are sure to brighten up their coat of arms. On the way to a natural swimming pool dug in the rocks, we witness, from afar (we did not dare to invite each other in a bathing suit), to a wedding on the beach. Yep, it's not just in American movies. Even the lighthouses on the peninsula are designer. After a visit to the ghost town of Inneston, built to house those who exploited the gypsum, the bitumen is tickled along the sole of the foot.

The tracing of the boot is coming to an end, we find good bottles in a small local vineyard to celebrate. Passing through Adelaide, we scrutinize with interest the know-how of glass blowers at the JAM factory.

The Fleurieu peninsula (promised this is the last) is only a stone's throw from Adelaide. The logistics are such that we travel it on weekends, in the company of almost all the inhabitants of Adelaide looking for a campsite on one of these "wild" beaches (which therefore looks more like a refugee camp than a wild beach :)). On Fleurieu, the sometimes wooded landscape in the national parks, sometimes lunar along the rocky cliffs is punctuated by imposing grassy hills yellowed by drought.

Bypassing Lake Alexandrina and Yari, we cross what was once Australian Mississippi. Paddle steamers connected the various ports of this immense complex of lakes. The Murray River winds its way through this labyrinth and the shortest path crosses the river several times. There is no bridge. Putting the Mentos on a barge to cross the longest river in Australia takes us to the Netherlands for a short crossing. A lagoon of more than 100km (distance altogether banal in this country-continent) separated from the ocean by a simple sand dune constitutes the national park of Coorong. This complex ecosystem is threatened by prolonged drought, dams and pumping of water throughout the course of the Murray which could one day stop flowing and silting up the lagoon. For the moment, the mouth of the river is kept open artificially by dredging. It is a paradise for pelicans and other birds ...

PS: why is there an overlapping ostrich statue in Meningie? At the end of 1800, a particularly skinny Irish emigrant made a living by robbing the premises and fled on the back of an ostrich in the marshes. He terrorized the region for several years but no one has ever found his booty after his tragic death ...
