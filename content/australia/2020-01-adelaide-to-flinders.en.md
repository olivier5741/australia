"Knock, knock, knock. Anyone there?" We're in one of Adelaide's main streets, on the first floor of the youth hostel. This is the room the lady at the reception told us to go to. "Oh, is Katy your mom?" she said with a surprised smile. "Yes, she is in her room". "Shrkkkk", the door opens and omg... For sure, it's not Katy, people don't change that much in a year! We had a good laugh with the receptionist over the misunderstanding and in any case Katy, back from her morning stroll, does not take long to arrive.

Let's get crazy !! Three people in the Mentos all over again... After a very quick visit of Adelaide (a museum and the botanical garden), we head towards the nearby countryside.

Sorry little feet, today you are locked up all day. We dust off our boots for a 18kms walk (finally 22kms according to Katy's step counter) through the gorges of Mount Remarkable National Park. Kangaroos, emus and large monitor lizards play hide and seek among the enormous eucalyptus trees in the park.

To give Katy a little taste of the outback, we leave for the Flinders Range: red dust, flies and breathtaking mineral landscape.

Summer isn't over yet, it's getting steaming hot, around 40 Â° C and our days end, if possible, in the water (at the campsite pool or in the sea) ...
