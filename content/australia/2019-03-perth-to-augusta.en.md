The basic development of the Mentos is finished. We put the last unused wood plates behind the bed for a version 2.

As we leave, David reminds us that Perth's beaches are the most beautiful in the world. We're gonna check !! We ended up extending our field of research to all the beaches of the south-west, until Augusta in the south.

Either the ocean gives us a hard time: perfect waves for average surfers (them) and very invigorating bath for the swimmer (us). Either it pleases us with its beaches of fine sand, its azure water and its beautiful sun. Either it gives us the full view with its coral reefs and fish worthy of "Finding Nemo". Thanks to very well developed public facilities, there are showers on almost every beach and our level of cleanliness remains very high despite campervan life. Not being able to barbecue is an attack on the freedom of the average Australian, so, to avoid putting the country on fire all the time (it's hot and very dry and windy), there are free public gas barbecues everywhere.

Against all odds, we were relatively accustomed to the local climate. As soon as the thermometer drops below 20 °C, we shiver and the Mentos is now equipped with a woollen blanket for cool nights (ie 15 ° C).

To make sure we don't run out of variety (and also to look for work ;)), we venture inland to bathe in fresh water =) and get a first taste of the outback: first gravel roads (the Mentos gets covered in orange dust) and first kangaroos! Our first walk ended in the dark (timing error :)) avoiding spiders, as big as ping-pong balls, which hindered the way, hanging in their web, and also watching the ground in case of snakes (we're novices in this matter at the beginning of our stay).

We try different channels for job search. We go directly to the orchard, buy a kilo of apples and ask the question innocently. At the end of a conversation, we leave our contact details on a small postit in a second-hand shop. The tourist office often has a list of employers of the area. The usual answer: "We just finished" or "Not before a couple of weeks". In short, we decide to volunteer.
