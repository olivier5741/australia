The two months initially planned to visit Tasmania stretch like chewing gum (9 months at last count), which is a must for our fitness. It's fairly steep in the region. But, when the weather is clear, the view is breathtaking! Anyway, waterfalls are always pretty when it rains...

With the weather getting milder, we leave for several days in the Walls of Jerusalem National Park. Almost all the hikers we talked to (especially Penny) recommended this place. The possibility of being under 1m of snow doesn't freeze our will. We are getting slightly accustomed to Tasmanian wilderness and are relatively well equipped. The temperature reaches 20Â°, it is sunny enough to meet two snakes, an echidna and a platypus. This will be our last night camping in a tent in Tasmania.

At the farm, we work our way up through the art of fencing (after digging trenches and connecting wires): Jason trains us to put up new fences. So we've probably reached the top of the fence! :)

Another step up: Penny and Steve go on holiday for five days and we are promoted dog-sitters. In other words, serving meals at fixed times, going for walks at the beach and the river but preventing Percy from sneaking away and eat the camels at the neighbouring zoo...

The last puzzle pieces of our journey are falling into place... Melbourne (where the ferry arrives) is now Covid free, our visa ends in February and we book our plane tickets from Perth. We have now two months to cross Australia from East to West. We enjoy some of our time left in Lorinna where our tasmanian stay started.

It's with great pleasure that we meet Marie, Scott, Zac and Rosie for some wild card games, warmth around the stove and lots of cute babies: chicks, ducklings, calf and little wallabi.

Baby calf means ... milk of course. Mary teaches us how to milk Lady Mow by hand. We are a little slow, so the cow gets a few more cups of oats to stay quiet. With a bucket of milk per day, there's no other choice than transforming it into some delicious cheeses.

Whether it is Gunns Plains or Lorinna, the community Christmas dinner is a tradition, the perfect place to network. Unfortunately, it is quite disappointing for our contacts when they hear that we are leaving Lorinna valley the next day. The same happens at the barbecue in Gunns Plains, two days before boarding the ferry. Fortunately, we manage to fill our agenda (we can't say we use it often) with three garden/property visits before we leave.

Our last challenge at the farm is to plant 150 native trees near the river. Under the watchful eye of the local platypus, the trees settle into their final residence. With a large hole, a tree guard and a pint of water, we wish them a pleasant future.

It's now our turn to change pot, we swap the luxurious Airbnb for our van. Ciao Penny, Steve, Percy and Lily. Ciao Tasmania. Arrivederci, ciao ! 

And Merry Christmas !!! ðŸ˜‰
