The jetty, this institution ... Historically, any self-respecting coastal village must, sooner or later, ask the government to build a pier. Whether to export grain, ore (gypsum, dolomite, copper, ...), wool and import all essential goods not produced on site (canned goods, sugar, soap, ...), c is a bit the umbilical cord of the village. Without it, a small intermediate boat has to shuttle between land and the largest boat moored in the distance, a tiring endeavor and totally dependent on the mood of the sea.

The flowering of the piers on the Eyre peninsula began 150 years ago. Subsequently, roads developed and the sea was no longer the only way to a more important port such as Adelaide. These solid wood constructions, several hundred meters long, all different: sometimes straight, curved, with or without shelter, are gradually falling into disuse. Some, too dilapidated, are shortened with dynamite. But the pier is anchored in the hearts of the inhabitants. With petitions and fundraising, they make new skins. Today, this local heritage is mainly used for recreational purposes because fish, crustaceans and octopuses like to wander between the posts that support the structure and the average Australian is rather a maniac of fishing. We will, from time to time, see with our own eyes what swarms there with mask and snorkel.

Eyre is the most imposing peninsula in South Australia. Its east coast, protected by the rest of the continent, offers many bucolic beaches, much appreciated by this scorching weather. Sometimes even dolphins are there ...

Like a cherry on the cake, the peninsula ends in a national park. After going down a pint at the local microbrewery, taking a shower at the marina, here we are. An obelisk reminiscent of the passage of the explorer Matthew Flinders (who mapped almost all of Australia and moreover suggested this name for the continent), another lighthouse, emus on the go and cute kangaroos await you . The peninsula is very famous for its seafood, our taste buds are outdone. It turns out that Port Lincoln is the tuna capital of the world, this requires verification. The tasting of seafood continues and, at Coffin Bay, there is a close interest in the oyster. We put on waders and, after a brief historical introduction, we are all in the water to join "the aquatic bar". We are explained the mode of basket culture: developed by an Australian, it spread around the world thanks to its efficiency but came up against French chauvinism. Learning to open the shell is undoubtedly followed by a tasting.

Katy ensures that the holidays remain hectic: in a very peaceful seaside town (understand "there was not a cat"), curious to know a little more, she opens the box of the public defibrillator. The alarm goes off (and yes there is an anti-theft device!) And a distant neighbor comes running to potentially help us. Another 100m more and we could have defibrilled the brave but more so young neighbor.

A little further, at Venus Bay, the recent (3 days ago) observation of a white shark (only 3m long) does not calm our heat: a quick jump from the pier is necessary and adrenaline does not not fail to get Olivier out of the water quickly.

We camp at the foot of "lifted stones" where only nature has worked on the process. More than a few beaches and cliffs separate us from Ceduna, the end of the peninsula and our first city after crossing the Nullarbor, almost a month ago now.

What good wind still brings us to Penong? Do we want to show the museum of wind energy pumps in Katy? Perhaps, but mainly we have an appointment with Bo, Maddie and Connor for a frenzied evening (Bo wanted to fight Olivier in table tennis). History will not remember who won but our route continues the next morning towards the East and the Yorke peninsula.

Maybe you are wondering if we come back soon? Our visa application for a second year of working holiday permit was indeed accepted !!! Rokiwi's adventures and other adventures can therefore continue for a few more months ... ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
