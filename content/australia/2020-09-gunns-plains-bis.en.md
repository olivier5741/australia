"Hey guys, it's going to be sunny for a few days. It's time to take a break," Penny exclaims. Trees are budding, clouds are scarce, the sun is shining, it's mild, spring is clearly on its way in Tasmania. We take the pole that Penny holds out to us but, with such considerations, we risk never working again... Pampered almost to excess, not sure we'll leave so soon...

![As soon as spring returns...](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mV95rYS-aP7eqVrDpSA4nemtSCu1kQa96VXUmNivFOzLEZyxldGHt8-uh-aqeh4EEkdd0otQDmzD4QHTie_PlVrfxbdZduZAnMFG1gucd16IzsHeIoQGzNfEW4mDKwJuRhhgSGMqEOU)

We pin our destination on the map: North West Tasmania, perfect to celebrate the team's 60th anniversary. The region abounds in Aboriginal remains: caves, remains of shellfish feast (20,000 generations tasting shellfish, that's a consequent mound of shells) and even delicate stone engravings. They had chosen their corner well: it seems that, at the present time, it is still here that one breathes the purest air in the world (elixir of eternal youth assured).

You leave the coast to go deep into the humid temperate forest. The road is controversial. For the record, our neighbour, Helmut, a sculptor, was arrested by the police during a demonstration to prevent the construction of the road (and thus access to the forest by loggers) some thirty years ago. It was in Tasmania that the world's first environmentalist party was born to fight against excessive logging.

We are ready to go to work: the buggy is parked in front of the workshop, the electric cable, the irrigation hose and the tools are in the back. Now all that remains is to solve the thorny problem of the bench. Unfortunately, there is not enough room for two dogs and two adults, so some of them will have to devote themselves to move to the back... The two "bench-warmers" watch us with interest as we dig the trench, lay the pipe, plug it up, put a cable through and connect the whole thing. The purpose of the operation is to make the current pass under the barrier and thus avoid a surge when the gate is open. Soon at noon, Penny is off work and is cooking her favourite soup of the moment: parsnip-carrot-apple (previously roasted in the oven) with a frank spoonful of mascarpone.

We had already hesitated to visit Maria Island a few months ago. Penny is going there with her brother and suggests that we go with her. We take the camping equipment on board and off we go! No car on this island refuge for the biodiversity, on the other hand hundreds of wombats (it is almost necessary to be careful not to stumble on it in the dark) and Tasmanian devils (that we didn't see but it is recommended to lock up our food in a locker if we don't want our tent torn by a greedy devil).

![Just to really celebrate Roro's thirties, we left for three days of horseback riding, one of them on the beach](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p9kSNUw71s_reUXdwfXpdxZRrFJ7WYOF8ZtmPzMHucLacw1gZzETdfeFF0No9URTlSuh-fUAm7deXlviVQK7raIMCPARnvMy6JTV6Yr-Sw5QuDo-NzT1GtDYQhODTaGSVdku2zm-E6s)

The sun is forecast on the west coast (where it rains on average three times (!!) more than in Belgium), we get out of our trenches for a few days. Tullah is the gateway to the deep west. The mining rush is now well blurred, but disused tram lines in Rosebery and moonlit hills in Queenstown echo a tumultuous past. Thanks to abundant rainfall, the rainforest is quick to bury these scars. The various waterfalls are carefully mapped so as not to miss a single one (including the island's highest, 104m) and then the focus is on the points of interest around the indomitable Franklin River. In Strahan, we witness a moving sunset over the "graves" of the 300 whales stranded here a few weeks ago (we were also hoping to find a devil looking for a whale steak gleaned on the beach, but nothing ...).

Well, that's not all, the trenches are not going to dig themselves. We've had a good time, we can return peacefully to the farm. I know some hairy people who will be happy to be able to lick our (almost) empty soup plates again.
