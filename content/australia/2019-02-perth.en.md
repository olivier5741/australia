Spring was slowly coming up in Belgium but we had other plans on the other side of the world... Our team of moms dropped us at the airport ... We knew that our luggage was not very heavy but 25kg for two, we are proud of us! (especially Rossana) (We learned from our past mistakes and have an emotional thought for all the more or less useless things we carried for a year in New Zealand;))

The trip went smoothly, our luggage did not even get lost. We set foot on the island continent almost "fresh" (there is only 7h jetlag). Leaving the air conditioning of the airport, we are blown by the heat and Olivier hastens to change shoes and unzip his pants in shorts ...

We have an appointment with David, our host, in the suburbs of Perth. FYI, Perth is on the west coast of Australia, 4000 km from Sydney. It is the largest city in Western Australia and the fourth largest in Australia. In short, a big city in the middle of nowhere ...

A parrot (almost as common as pigeons in Europe), the few skyscrapers (it remains the are 'bungalows') and a glimpse of street art)

David welcomes us with a good dinner and shows us around his house, the pool and the garden. In exchange for half a day's work, we are housed and fed. As good volunteers, we take care of the maintenance of the exteriors, we help him in some administrative tasks and, most important, we spend time with Luna, the dog of the house ... Walks in the park and frisbee throwing!

We fill our afternoons with jumps in the pool, sorting our papers and, above all, the research, the purchase and the transformation of our future cozy nest for the rest of our adventures, namely the "chariot" third of the name! We found the chosen one but its transformation into a perfect mobile home takes a lot of time ...

The next episode, soon !! :)
