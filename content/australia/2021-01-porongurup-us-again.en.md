Going back to Nic, Scottie and Emerson's house is a bit like going home after a long absence. You're super happy to get home, you make yourself at home because you remember where everything is stored but there are always little things that have changed. It only takes a few hours for Em to be completely at ease with us. The man is chatting happily compared to last year and he still loves his trampoline.

Not surprisingly, miles of fences need repair and polishing. There are also the seven cows to be milked in the morning (the ewes are off for the summer and waiting for the next lambs in the late autumn) and the calves to be separated in the evening. We also look after Andrew, the little orphaned lamb who eagerly awaits his bottle every four hours.

Two more mouths to feed (us...), no question of letting the crows plunder the chickens' kot. We barricade the pen with netting to prevent any diversion of eggs. It rains tomatoes endlessly: Roro is in the oven to transform them into delicious tomato sauce while Bibi assembles a life-size sheep (a piece of art perhaps) for Nic's birthday. Then comes the project of building a shady green walkway and rearranging the workshop (an expert version of a real tetris).

The Mentos, our coach, is too big to go back to Belgium with us. It's so beautiful and well equipped that we're snatching it up like a hotcake. In no time at all, we were pedestrians! But it will continue to have great adventures with an Australian woman who goes to pick mangoes. A tent and Nic and Scottie's pickup truck support us for a last trip to Two People's Bay and Denmark.

Still in the "managing my future life" category, Roro gets a job at the GAL in Libramont two weeks before the return while Bibi (in the "a little less" category) expands his network by participating in a 48h hackathon in the framework of open data. 

After this intense professional week, the days are numbered. Um, what can you buy with Mentos money? We scour the various stalls and market stalls for as many souvenirs as possible. We don't miss sleeping under the stars for our last night. Fact to be confirmed, is the milky way whiter from a dairy farm?

Our last Australian adventure is to arrive at Perth airport on a Sunday with our huge luggage. Public transport is impractical on Sundays. The plane on a domestic flight doesn't appreciate our 60kgs of souvenirs. The rental car costs an arm and a leg because we drop it off at a different location. We leave notes in the local cafes and on the second hand website for carpooling. As nothing shows up, we fall back on the rental car, we have to go and pick it up on Saturday at 9am. At 8.40am, we receive a message from a certain Dave who offers to bring a car to Perth tomorrow. It's so timely that it's almost suspicious, but in a hurry we go to his house to see the car. If it's a drug deal, it's well disguised: it's a tiny car dating from 1998, which does 95km/h. The advantage of driving at this speed, in such a light vehicle, is that we have hardly used any petrol. The cranberry (its little nickname found by Nic) takes us slowly but surely to Perth for a last swim in the Indian Ocean before dropping it off at its future owner's. A taxi to the airport, some forms to fill in for the covid and here we are, back in Belgium, ready for more adventures!
