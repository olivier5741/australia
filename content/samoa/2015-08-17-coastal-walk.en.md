The food at Maota-o-Ma'a is far too rich. We decide to go for a walk to burn some calories. After our host kindly drop us along the main road, we walk 3.5kms to reach "the coastal walk". It goes on top of lava cliffs where massive waves crashed, eroding arches and blowholes. Temperature is rising and we open our first picnic coconut.

We walk back to the main road under a blazing sun (3.5kms again). We carry on with a walk through the jungle to the Ma Tree, an uncommon species of tree with huge roots.

It's still very hot and mosquitoes are attracted by our sweaty bodies. We carry on walking 3 kms in the jungle with a jump in Togitogiga waterfall as reward. To work up courage, we open our second coconut. This bath is "wonderful as"... We take the public bus back to Tafatafa where Olivier's birthday barbecue outweighs all our efforts. But never mind... :)
