Rokiwi has a new look and is back in service ...

To enjoy a last trip in our "tomato" and get rid of almost three years of routine before Australia, we gave ourselves five weeks of travel in Europe ...

![The tomato, our car.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RXs5IPzcRDBcBw7zXs90XhI5Tf-WqpacbQOjbiitwPuB9mbqdQL98nZTxUqZ9biLpxXPL3ME4btaLHLsYYtmaBFZc7_gI6fZmnTf309OYkCx_NMzt_JS2C77eyJHI4OLpgLcdqzxrHc=w600)

First stop: the British Isles. We took the ferry from Calais to Dover and we have three days to reach Fishguard in Wales where a ferry to Ireland is waiting for us. On the way, English breakfast, visit Bristol and many walks in the English countryside.

Ireland greets us under bright sunshine with its emerald green meadows, white sheep and jagged cliffs.

We meet Luca in Cork. It has become a real local who knows the good addresses in terms of pubs and Irish breakfast. When you are part of the world of work, you have to ... work :). Luca does not escape this imperative, so we combine with his work schedule. Three days off to him, there we go !!

Fortunately, the tomato can accommodate up to 3 people in both rolling and sleeping. After a first night in sardine mode, we find comfort in a "luxurious" caravan for the two nights we have left.

The Wild Atlantic Way is nearly 5000 kilometers long and runs along the west coast of Ireland. It's one of the longest 'scenic routes' in the world! Quality going over quantity requires: we follow its curve around the Beara Peninsula only.

Inland to the west of Cork is the Killarney National Park. This nature park is home to the highest mountain in Ireland. On the way to its base, we pass friendly clippers: sheep and donkeys. Our last tomato night is at Gap of Dunloe, a rocky, lunar valley. We will remember the road trip that took us there along the lake and its marshy tributary basins.

Due to bad weather, our departure for Santander (near Bilbao) is delayed by two days. We write to you from the ferry, the trip lasts 28 hours. The boat is not very big, nor very loaded, the sea is not very calm and neither of us is a good sailor ... It will be a little long ... :)
